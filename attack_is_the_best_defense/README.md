# What Is a Network Sniffer?

Network sniffing is the use of a software tool, called a network sniffer, that monitors or sniffs the data flowing over computer network links in real-time. This software tool is either a self-contained software program or a hardware device with the appropriate software or firmware.

Network sniffers take snapshot copies of the data flowing over a network without redirecting oraltering it. Some sniffers work only with TCP/IP packets, but the more sophisticated tools workwith many other network protocols and at lower levels, including Ethernet frames.

# What Is ARP Spoofing?

ARP spoofing is a type of attack in which a malicious actor sends falsified ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) messages over a local area network. This results in the linking of an attacker’sMAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network. Once the attacker’s MAC address is connected to an authentic IP address, the attacker will begin receivingany data that is intended for that IP address. ARP spoofing can enable malicious parties to intercept, modify or even stop data in-transit. ARP spoofing attacks can only occur on local areanetworks that utilize the Address Resolution Protocol.
