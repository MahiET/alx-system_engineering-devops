HTTP VS HTTPS
=

Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which data is sent between your browser and the website that you are connected to. The 'S' at the end of HTTPS stands for 'Secure'. It means all communications between your browser and the website are encrypted. HTTPS is often used to protect highly confidential online transactions like online banking and online shopping order forms.

Web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome also display a padlock icon in the address bar to visually indicate that a HTTPS connection is in effect

Firewall
=

A firewall is a division between a private network and an outer network, often the internet, that manages traffic passingbetween the two networks. It’s implemented through either hardware or software. Firewalls allow, limit, and block networktraffic based on preconfigured rules in the hardware or software, analyzing data packets that request entry to the network. In addition to limiting access to computers and networks, a firewall is also useful for allowing remote access to a private network through secure authentication certificates and logins

Single point of failure
=
A single point of failure (SPOF) is a part of a system that, if it fails, will stop the entire system from working.[1] SPOFs are undesirable in any system with a goal of high availability or reliability, be it a business practice, software application, or other industrial system.

What is LAMP?

A “LAMP” stack is a group of open-source software that is typically installed together to enable a server to host dynamic websites and web apps. This term is actually an acronym which represents the Linux operating system, with the Apache web server. The site data is stored in a MySQL database, and dynamic content is processed by PHP.
